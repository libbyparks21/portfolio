            <p>Tire Marks Effect  <br> Created in Houdini FX for "Student Accomplice" - September 2023 <br> <br>
                
                Utilized the curve that represents the path of the car (Extracted from the carâ€™s alembic file).
                
                Generated UV'd geometry where the tires would mark the ground.
                
                Adjusted the darkness of the skid marks based on the car's curvature, making them darker on turns and lighter on straightaways.
                
                Offered adjustable parameters for tire width, tire color, and skid mark length for a customizable effect. <br> <br>

                Houdini sim, rendered in Karma and composited in Nuke.

                Shaped with a lot of disturbance, turbulence, and collisions with a rough model of the truck.  <br> <br>

                Tree Simulation and Modeling <br>
                Created in Speedtree for Houdini Layout - November 2023 <br> <br>
                
                Populated city with trees that matched the style, simulated them to reflect that it is a calm autumn day. And kept it LIGHTWEIGHT. Trees had to react to an explosion.
                Modeled and designed 8 different trees with unique "wonky" feeling.
                Added a calm, physically accurate leaf and branch simulation.
                Added them to the current layout using the USD Pipeline. 
                Optimized layout by assuring that only the trees in focus will move and drop leaves, the rest will be static instanced copies for background feel. Created a  simulation for the trees reacting to the explosion. <br> <br>

                Created in Maya, Substance Painter, Houdini, and Nuke -  September 2021 <br> <br>
                Procedurally modeled each lace to wrap around a deformed figure eight using Maya. 
                Textured in Substance Painter, then pulled into Houdini for lighting and rendering. Composited into a still image using Nuke. <br> <br>
